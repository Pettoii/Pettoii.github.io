        <h2>🎮 Presentation</h2>
        <p><strong>Cubequest</strong> is a puzzle-platformer where you play as <strong>Cube</strong>, a robot from the future. The goal is to traverse three distinct worlds to collect essential parts and return to the starting point.</p>
        <p>The gameplay is built on an original concept: <strong>the player possesses a numerical "value" (between 1 and 9)</strong>, which affects their <strong>size, interactions, and abilities</strong>.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>🧩 Core Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Score:</strong> The cube displays a value between 1 and 9. If this value falls outside this range, the player dies.</li>
            <li><strong>Size Changing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1–3: Small</li>
                    <li>4–6: Medium</li>
                    <li>7–9: Large</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Colored Batteries:</strong> These modify the player's value using operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), with each color representing a different effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Ball:</strong> The player can throw a ball whose range depends on their size. This ball can also interact with batteries and solve puzzles from a distance.</li>
            <li><strong>Systemic Interaction:</strong> Most game mechanics can interact with one another, leading to dynamic and creative puzzles.</li>
        </ul>
